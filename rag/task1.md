look in `gameV1/data/eras.json`

we have done fact check about the sources.
but i dont see any correlation to reality about the pivot data of wealth and jobs creation

for every each pivot, find a source supporting the wealth and/or job net change, and add it as another property in pivot.

take it slow 1 by 1 and ultrathink.

do not stop until you complete everything.


this task was already partially done by you but you got stuck. you need to complete from era 10 and on. 

so do not do all eras, only 10 and on.
